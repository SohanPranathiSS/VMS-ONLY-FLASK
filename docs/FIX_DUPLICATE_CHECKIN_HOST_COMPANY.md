# Fix: Duplicate Check-In Prevention Now Uses Host Company Name

## Problem Fixed
The duplicate check-in error message was showing the visitor's company name instead of the host's company name. For example:

**Before (incorrect):**
> "You are already checked in for Pranathi (Software Services Pvt.Ltd., A subsidiary of Software Programming Group (USA)) today at 2025-08-15 06:41:05. Please check out first before checking in again."

**After (correct):**
> "You are already checked in for ABC Corporation today at 2025-08-15 06:41:05. Please check out first before checking in again."

Where "ABC Corporation" is the name of the host company being visited.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend API Endpoint (`Backend/app.py`)
**Modified the duplicate check query:**
- **Before:** Checked based on visitor's company name (`vis.company`)
- **After:** Checks based on host's company ID (`v.company_id`) and retrieves host company name

```sql
-- OLD QUERY
SELECT v.*, vis.company as visitor_company, vis.name as existing_visitor_name
FROM visits v
JOIN visitors vis ON v.visitor_id = vis.id
WHERE vis.email = %s 
AND vis.company = %s  -- Used visitor's company
...

-- NEW QUERY  
SELECT v.*, vis.name as existing_visitor_name, c.company_name as host_company_name
FROM visits v
JOIN visitors vis ON v.visitor_id = vis.id
JOIN companies c ON v.company_id = c.id  -- Added join to get host company
WHERE vis.email = %s 
AND v.company_id = %s  -- Now uses host company ID
...
```

**Updated error message:**
```python
# Before
'message': f'You are already checked in for {visitor_company} today at {check_in_time}...'

# After  
'message': f'You are already checked in for {host_company_name} today at {check_in_time}...'
```

### 2. Visit Model (`Backend/src/models/visit.py`)
**Updated method signature and logic:**
- **Before:** `check_duplicate_checkin(visitor_email, visitor_company)`
- **After:** `check_duplicate_checkin(visitor_email, company_id)`

### 3. Test Files Updated
- `test_duplicate_checkin.py`: Updated to use company_id instead of visitor company name
- `test_api_duplicate_checkin.py`: Updated test scenarios for host company logic

### 4. Documentation Updated
- `docs/features/DUPLICATE_CHECKIN_PREVENTION.md`: Updated to reflect host company logic

## Business Logic Changes

### What Constitutes a Duplicate (Updated)
1. **Same Visitor Email**: Identifies the same person
2. **Same Host Company**: Prevents multiple check-ins for the same host organization ⬅️ CHANGED
3. **Same Date**: Only checks for duplicates on the current date
4. **Checked-In Status**: Only considers active check-ins

### What Is Allowed (Updated)
1. **Different Host Companies**: Same visitor can check in for different host organizations ⬅️ CHANGED
2. **Different Days**: Same visitor can check in for the same host company on different days
3. **After Check-Out**: Same visitor can check in again after checking out

## Impact

### Before This Fix
- Visitor "John Doe" from "ABC Corp" visits "XYZ Company"
- If he tries to check in again at "XYZ Company", error would say:
  > "You are already checked in for ABC Corp today..."
- **Confusing** because ABC Corp is where the visitor works, not where he's visiting

### After This Fix
- Same scenario now shows:
  > "You are already checked in for XYZ Company today..."
- **Clear** because XYZ Company is where the visitor is actually visiting

## Testing

### Manual Test Steps
1. Log in as a host from Company A
2. Check in a visitor (e.g., visitor@example.com)
3. Try to check in the same visitor again at Company A
4. Error should show: "You are already checked in for Company A today..."
5. Log in as a host from Company B  
6. Try to check in the same visitor at Company B - should succeed

### Expected Behavior
- ✅ Prevents duplicate check-ins at the same host company
- ✅ Allows check-ins at different host companies
- ✅ Shows correct host company name in error messages
- ✅ Maintains all existing functionality

## Database Schema Impact
No database schema changes required. The fix uses existing relationships:
- `visits.company_id` → `companies.id` → `companies.company_name`

## Backward Compatibility
✅ **Fully backward compatible** - no breaking changes to API endpoints or database structure.

## Files Modified
1. `/Backend/app.py` - Updated duplicate check logic
2. `/Backend/src/models/visit.py` - Updated method signature  
3. `/Backend/test_duplicate_checkin.py` - Updated unit tests
4. `/Backend/test_api_duplicate_checkin.py` - Updated integration tests
5. `/docs/features/DUPLICATE_CHECKIN_PREVENTION.md` - Updated documentation

The fix ensures that duplicate check-in error messages now correctly display the host company name (where the visitor is visiting) rather than the visitor's own company name.
